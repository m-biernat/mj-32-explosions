## About

Bombsite is a **puzzle** game made in **~48h** during [Mini Jam 32: Explosions](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-32-explosions).  The main goal is to **"destroy"** all elements present on the level. The player can **place bombs** in highlighted places.  Bombs have a limited area of effect.  For each level, there is a **time limit**, after which the placed **bombs explode** one by one. The player has to progress through **10 levels** to beat the game.
